# BER-of-Nakagami-fading-channel
Performance of Bit Error Probabilities of M-QAM, M-PAK, I-PAM for a channel subjected to impulsive noise and Nakagami fading.
In this project, The Bit Error Probability (BEP) of the M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation scheme (M-QAM), M-ary Phase Shift Keying scheme (M-PSK), I-ary Pulse Amplitude Modulation scheme (I-PAM) for a channel model characterized by double gated additive white Gaussian noise (G2AWGN) and Nakagami fading are evaluated. 
The Additive noise is obtained by considering a method in which the multiplicative fading is transformed in an additive noise R obtained by dividing the received signal by the estimated fading envelope. 
                       R(t) = ƞ(t)/γ
The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of the random variable R that represent the aforementioned noise obtained for the G2AWGN and Nakagami were evaluated.
The CDF of the random variable R is able to represent error function of BEP (erfc= 2-2*CDF(a(i,M)Eb)) hence BEP is evaluated. The BEP of M-QAM, M-PSK, I-PAM differ in their characterization and are evaluated according to their properties.
The BEP of M-QAM, M-PSK, I-PAM curves as function of the signal to permanent noise ratio for several values of the signal to impulsive noise ratio.
